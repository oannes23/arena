## Overview

Traits and Perks are the growth and identity system. Traits are the core building blocks of character identity — attached to Trait Slots, they unlock trees of Perks. Perks are the atomic unit of character capability: multi-component packages of Actions, Stat Adjustments, and Triggers. This domain is separate from Characters (which defines the chassis) because Traits/Perks represent the entire growth system with its own leveling, requirements, and acquisition mechanics.
