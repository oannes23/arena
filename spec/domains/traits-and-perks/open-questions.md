# Open Questions

All structural, mechanical, and game design questions are resolved. Three non-blocking items are deferred:

1. **MVP content examples** (deferred to implementation): What are the specific ~3 Core, ~4 Role, ~2 Bond Traits with their 3–5 Perks each? This is content authoring, not design.
2. **Combat-triggered Trait discovery** (deferred to later phase): Can characters acquire entirely new Traits (not just Perks) through combat events?
3. **Automatic underdog balancing** (deferred to new meta-balance spec): Win/loss ratio tracking per Trait with automatic bonuses for underperforming Traits. Cross-cutting system requiring its own specification.

## Implications for Other Specs

| Spec | Implication |
|------|-------------|
| [characters](../characters.md) | Trait Slot count defined by Character Star Rating. Core Traits may modify anatomical slots. Species = Core Traits pattern (no hardcoded species list). Post-combat phase now includes Perk Discovery resolution (accept/reject) alongside injury/death checks, NPC recruitment, and loot. |
| [combat](../combat/index.md) | Perks provide Actions (combat abilities), Stat Adjustments (combat stats), and Triggers (combat reactions). Simultaneous Trigger resolution (all qualifying Triggers fire together, no ordering). **Type-ordered** effect resolution within Actions: status/debuff → damage/healing → movement (defined by combat spec). Resource pool system: open/extensible, attribute-derived base + Perk bonus capacity (pre-multiplier), pools activate when first Perk references a resource. Multi-resource Action costs (any combo of pools). Resource pools start at full capacity; no default regen for Trait-granted resources (regen comes from Perks/Triggers). Per-stat scaling multipliers for resource pools (also amplify bonus capacity). Trait/Perk level amplification multipliers — shared curve ×1.0/×1.2/×1.4/×1.7/×2.0 (tuning values). Tag-scoped Stat Adjustments can be flat or percentage; percentages stack additively across different tags on the same Action; application order: flat → percentage on already-scaled values. All cooldowns reset per-combat (no cross-fight persistence). Tradeoff Perks (negative Stat Adjustments / harmful Triggers) possible via existing components. Combat spec defines: canonical target tag vocabulary and resolution rules, canonical Trigger event type vocabulary, canonical effect component type catalog. Combat Scoreboard tracks per-character stats including Actions used (determines active Traits for Perk Discovery). |
| [post-combat](../post-combat.md) | Perk Discovery: per-Trait end-of-combat roll for active Traits only. Base rate modified by Luck/Perks (additive) then ×Trait level (×1.0–×2.0). No rate cap — small trees are natural limit. Resolution: accept/reject per discovery. Post-combat also handles injury/death, recruitment, and loot. |
| [equipment](../equipment/index.md) | Equipment can require specific Traits/Perks (acquisition-only check — stays equipped if requirement later unmet). Affix bonuses can enhance specific Perks. Tags create Perk–equipment synergies (shared tag vocabulary, including auto-tags from resources). Variable anatomy from ancestry Core Traits affects available slots. |
| [consumables](../consumables.md) | Specialist Perks (Bomber, Apothecary) amplify consumable effectiveness. Scribe Perk enables Scroll creation from known Perks. Tags create Perk–consumable synergies. |
| [combat-ai](../combat-ai.md) | Personality archetype tags on Core Traits feed the AI Personality Score track. Each Perk Action includes an `ai` block (gates, tactical_scorers, personality_scorers) that defines how the Utility AI evaluates it. AI must evaluate multi-resource Action costs, tag-scoped Stat Adjustment bonuses (including multi-tag additive stacking), and tag-based targeting. Default Actions (Combatant system Trait) have embedded Considerations. **Key challenge**: No Action count limit — Utility AI must efficiently score 20-40+ Actions per character. |
| [economy](../economy.md) | Trainer service fees (gold) for Trait/Perk leveling. Respec gold cost formula. XP cost schedule (100/300/600/1000/1500) interacts with economy balance. Group-specific trainer fee model (specialist vs. generalist pricing differences). XP cost as natural gate for high-star Traits on low-star characters. Discovery modifier stacking should be monitored — trainers must remain primary acquisition path. Economic scarcity is a primary driver of build diversity. |
| [groups](../groups.md) | Trait generation loot table definitions per Group/archetype. Respec is a Group vendor service. Trainer services for Trait/Perk acquisition and leveling. Bond Traits map to specific Groups — one Bond Trait per Group per character. Trainer availability model: Group-specific theme alignment, generalist Groups for baseline access. Bond Trait hybrid scaling: smooth benefits (price, breadth) + discrete tier unlocks (exclusive items at 3★, unique services at 5★). Bond Trait Perks include combat capabilities (hybrid utility + combat pattern). |
| [tournaments](../tournaments.md) | Star-gated tournament entry (1★-only, 3★-only, open) to manage power gaps. Per-combat cooldown reset means no cross-fight cooldown attrition in multi-round events. Power gap between star levels is intentional — build quality should enable underdog victories. |
| [roster-management](../roster-management.md) | Trait composition drives character hiring value. Respec is a vendor service in the economy. Starter Perks affect character readiness at recruitment. Empty Trait categories are valid post-respec states. Roster pressure is a primary driver of build diversity — no single character can cover all situations. |
| [meta-balance](../../architecture/meta-balance.md) | **NEW SPEC NEEDED**. Automatic underdog balancing: win/loss ratio tracking per Trait, automatic bonuses for underperforming Traits. Prevents solved meta and ensures build diversity. Needs to define: tracking scope (per-Trait? per-combination?), bonus calculation, update frequency, player visibility. |
| [data-model](../../architecture/data-model.md) | Trait/Perk data shape definition needed: Trait → Perk tree, tag lists, loot table weights. Resource type definitions are content data (name, pool formula, auto-tag) — not hardcoded schema. Perk components need structured representation: Actions (target tags, effect component list, speed, cooldown, resource costs), Stat Adjustments (two subtypes: flat `{stat_key, value}` and tag-scoped `{tag, stat_key, value, value_type: "flat"|"percentage"}`), Triggers (event type, effect component list). Effect components use generic typed format (type tag + key-value parameters). Prerequisite graph must be acyclic (content validation). |

_Last updated: 2026-02-18 — Perk Discovery model changed from per-Action/Trigger-use during combat to per-Trait end-of-combat roll. "Active Traits only" rule replaces "passive Stat Adjustments don't trigger." Added post-combat.md cross-references. Previous: 2026-02-17 AI Considerations added. 2026-02-16 effect resolution order update._
